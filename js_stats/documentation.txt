basic description:
stats_handler is a class meant for handling statistics.
it stores the data in a folder.
the data is made out of string:int (text:number) pairs.
each pair also has an index.

constructor(folder)
this function sets up the handler and pairs it with a data folder.
input: folder is the folder with the data.
if you input a folder that doesn't exist, it will be created and initialized with the proper files, no other input is needed.

save()
no input needed, this function saves the current state of the handler.
keep in mind, unless you call this function, any change made to the data will NOT be saved

load()
no inputs needed, this function loads data from the files, it is automatically called in the constructor.
you probably won't have to use it ever.

add_stat(name)
this function adds a new stat (string:int pair) to the data.
input: name is the name of the stat.

in this doc, I will use the term "stat's identifier", an identifier is either the index of a stat or its name.

this function returns the value of a specific stat.
input: stat is the identifier for the stat.

set(stat, value)

input: stat is the identifier.

increase(stat, amount)
this function increases a certain stat's value by a certain amount.
input: stat is the identifier.
       amount is the amount.

reset()
no inputs needed, this function sets all values to 0.

indexOf(stat)
this function returns a stat's index.
input: stat is the stat's name.

DebugOutput()
